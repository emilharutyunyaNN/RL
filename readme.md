#Manual implementation of Reinforcement learning concepts
In reinforcement learning as in other areas implementing concepts manualy is important.
I have an ongoing class of reinforcement learning and I am implementing the concepts we cover on the go.

  -- Policy Iteration

  -- Value Iteration

  -- Monte Carlo learning

  -- Temporal Difference learning

  --to be continued ...

All of the above to this point are implemented to extract a policy for a simple Gridworld MDP design with 2 terminal states, 
and four types of movements each having -1 reward until terminal states are reached, and actions leading outside gridworld leave the agent in the same cell.
